# LLM Context for keshavrao.com Project

## About Me
- Building in public, late night coding sessions
- Interested in flow states, music + tech intersection
- Writing style: lowercase, raw thoughts, authentic voice
- Current blog at keshavrao.com

## Current Stack
- React 18 with Create React App
- TailwindCSS (minimalist black/white design)
- React Router v7
- Framer Motion for animations
- No TypeScript (yet)
- No external APIs - static content focused

## Content Philosophy
- Raw, unpolished thoughts > perfect prose
- Document the journey, not just outcomes
- Mix technical depth with personal insights
- Focus on flow states and creativity
- Late night building sessions documented

## What I Want to Build
[DEFINE YOUR NEW PROJECT IDEA HERE]
- What problem does it solve?
- Who is it for?
- What makes it unique?
- Technical requirements?

## Design Principles
- Minimalist UI (current site is black/white)
- Typography-first approach
- Fast, responsive, accessible
- Beautiful without being overdone

## Content Areas
1. Tech & Flow State
   - Coding sessions and creative energy
   - Building in public
   - Tools that enhance flow

2. Music & Technology
   - DJ sets and coding synergy
   - Creative process parallels
   - Building tools for creators

3. Personal Journey
   - Startup life experiences
   - Learning in public
   - Experiments and breakthroughs

## Technical Preferences
- Start simple, iterate fast
- 80/20 rule - focus on what matters
- Ship early, improve often
- Prefer proven tools over bleeding edge
- Documentation is part of the build

## Working Style with AI
- Keep responses to 2-3 bullets max
- Create hyperspecific tasks
- Apply 80/20 rule
- Focus on shipping, not perfection

## Current Pain Points
- Blog has placeholder content (2027 dates)
- Two content systems (hardcoded + markdown)
- Need to decide on content approach
- Want more interactive features

## Ideas to Explore
- Interactive writing guide/tool
- Portfolio with unique twist
- Music + code visualization
- Flow state tracker/enhancer
- Creator tools
- Something that combines interests

## Questions for New Project
1. Should it integrate with existing blog or be separate?
2. What's the MVP we can ship in a week?
3. How can it showcase both technical and creative sides?
4. What would make it memorable/shareable?

NEXT STEPS:
1. Define the specific project idea
2. Outline core features (MVP)
3. Choose tech stack
4. Create implementation plan
5. Start building

Remember: Ship fast, iterate based on feedback, keep it authentic.
