# Writing Style Analysis - Sentences

## Paul Graham
"You can't simultaneously optimize two unrelated things; when you push one far enough, you always end up sacrificing the other."

## Cal Newport
"If I explained what I was working on out loud, however, it helped keep me focused. Yesterday, for example, I gave Max a mini-lecture on the derivatives of trigonometric functions. He responded, naturally, by crying. But I still found it useful."

## Tim Ferriss
"Most 'superheroes' are nothing of the sort. They're weird, neurotic creatures who do big things DESPITE lots of self-defeating habits and self-talk."

**Note:** Feels human - authentic, vulnerable, honest about contradiction

## Paul Graham (on rhythm)
"When writing sounds good, it's mostly because it has good rhythm. But the rhythm of good writing is not the rhythm of music, or the meter of verse. It's not so regular. If it were, it wouldn't be good, because the rhythm of good writing has to match the ideas in it, and ideas have all kinds of different shapes."

**Note:** LOVE THIS - content AND execution. The sentences themselves demonstrate the rhythm they're describing.
