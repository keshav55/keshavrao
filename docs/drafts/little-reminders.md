- paper cuts and tiny wounds
  - like nature's push notifications
  - small stings that say "hey, you're here"
  - body's way of grounding you
  - physical anchors to the present moment

- maybe pain isn't always bad
  - little hurts keep us aware
  - skin peeling, tiny bleeds
  - each one a micro-meditation
  - forced mindfulness

- stream continues...

- K
