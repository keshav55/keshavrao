minimal lyrics
maximum flow
just the beats and the code

green tea steam rising
like ideas taking shape
in functions and loops

there's something pure about it
when the music has no words
just rhythm guiding your fingers
across the keyboard

you don't need lyrics
when you're writing your own story
in code

maybe one day
i'll be the one making these beats
mixing code and music
creating flow states for other builders

for now though
this is my studio
vim and green tea
someone else's beats
my own kind of flow

not everything needs to be shared
some moments are just for you
just for the craft
just for the flow

but this one
this one felt worth writing down
