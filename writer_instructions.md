# Writer Instructions - Collaborative Essay Framework

This document outlines the collaborative writing process we've developed for building essays with an AI partner. Use this framework to structure your next essay project.

## Overview

This is a **podcast-like, iterative writing experience** that prevents writer's block by breaking the essay into clear phases and building it collaboratively, one idea at a time.

**Key benefits:**
- Eliminates blank page paralysis
- Forces precision through defending each sentence
- Builds structure before writing prose
- Separates research, ideation, and drafting phases

## File Structure

Create these three files for your essay:

### 1. `[essay_name]_points.md`
**Purpose:** Track thesis statements and contentions for each section.

**Structure per section:**
```
## [Section Number]. [Section Title]

**Thesis:** [One clear statement of what this section argues]

**Contentions:**
1. [Supporting point 1]
2. [Supporting point 2]
3. [Supporting point 3]
4. [Supporting point 4 - optional]
```

**Rules:**
- Thesis must be a single declarative sentence
- Contentions are 2-4 supporting arguments (not full paragraphs)
- This file evolves as you talk through ideas
- Keep it to bullet points—no full prose yet

### 2. `[essay_name]_evidence.md`
**Purpose:** Collect examples, metaphors, quotes, and supporting data as you develop ideas.

**Structure:**
```
## Data Points & Quotes
- [Specific fact or quote with source]

## Metaphors & Analogies
- [Comparison that illustrates the point]

## Real Examples
- [Concrete scenario or story]

## [Key Person/Source] References
- [Relevant quote or principle]
```

**Rules:**
- Add evidence as it comes up naturally in conversation
- Tag evidence with which section it supports (if relevant)
- Don't worry about polish—raw notes are fine
- This becomes your ammunition for the full essay

### 3. `[essay_name]_v1.md`
**Purpose:** The full essay draft, written sentence by sentence with rigor.

**Structure:**
- One section per section number
- Use the thesis + contentions as your blueprint
- Pull evidence from the evidence file
- Every sentence must earn its place
- 3 sentences max per response when drafting (one idea at a time)

## The Process

### Phase 1: Structure Building (You Are Here)

1. **Define the essay:**
   - What's the core argument?
   - Who's the audience?
   - What's the outcome you want?

2. **Outline all sections:**
   - Thesis for each section
   - Contentions (2-4 per section)
   - Let the writer (AI) push back and refine

3. **Talk through ideas:**
   - One section at a time
   - Have the writer ask clarifying questions
   - Iterate until the thesis feels bulletproof
   - Don't move to the next section until this one is locked

### Phase 2: Evidence & Examples (Optional Before Drafting)

1. **Gather support:**
   - Add data points, quotes, metaphors to `_evidence.md`
   - Real scenarios and stories
   - Anything that makes the argument concrete

2. **Tag the evidence:**
   - Note which section each piece supports
   - This makes drafting easier

### Phase 3: Full Essay Drafting

1. **Go section by section:**
   - Writer drafts based on thesis + contentions
   - You review and feedback
   - Iterate until it's right

2. **Be ruthless about language:**
   - Every sentence must earn its place
   - Cut anything that doesn't support the thesis
   - Polish for voice and flow

3. **Use the Challenger School method:**
   - Thesis statement
   - Contentions (supporting points)
   - Evidence/Examples (data, quotes, metaphors, real examples)

## Key Principles

### 1. One Idea at a Time
- Don't overwhelm with multiple thoughts
- Let each idea develop fully before moving on
- Writer responds with 3 sentences max per response

### 2. Interactive & Conversational
- Writer asks clarifying questions
- Push back if something doesn't land
- Debate the ideas until they're sharp

### 3. Separating Thinking from Writing
- Points file = what you're arguing
- Evidence file = proof and illustration
- v1 file = polished prose

This prevents getting stuck trying to write and think simultaneously.

### 4. Precision Over Speed
- When drafting, defend every sentence
- No fluff or filler
- Each word earns its place

### 5. Audience First
- Define who you're writing for early
- Keep them in mind for tone, examples, level of detail
- Writer should understand the audience as well as you do

## Workflow Tips

**Starting a new essay:**
1. Brief the writer with context doc (like hoam.md)
2. Build sections one at a time
3. Lock thesis + contentions before moving on
4. Add evidence as conversation flows naturally

**When you're stuck:**
- Ask the writer: "What am I missing here?"
- Ask for examples of what you mean
- Have the writer suggest contentions and you refine them

**When drafting:**
- Review one section at a time
- Feedback should be specific: "This sentence doesn't support the thesis" or "This feels too technical for the audience"
- Iterate until it clicks

**Managing your time:**
- Phase 1 (Structure) = 30-60 min per section typically
- Phase 2 (Evidence) = as-needed, can happen during Phase 1
- Phase 3 (Drafting) = 20-30 min per section of polish

## Example Interaction Pattern

**You:** What does X really mean in practice?

**Writer:** [Explains with a concrete example]

**You:** Yes, but also consider Y aspect...

**Writer:** [Incorporates Y, asks clarifying question]

**You:** Exactly. That's the key point.

**Writer:** [Captures as contention]

**You:** Ready for the next section?

**Writer:** Which one?

## The Psychology Behind This

- **Blank page paralysis:** Eliminated by having clear structure first
- **Context switching:** Avoided by doing one section at a time
- **Precision:** Improved by defending single sentences instead of writing full sections
- **Flow:** Maintained by keeping the conversation tight and interactive
- **Ownership:** Stays with you because you're making every judgment call

This process treats writing like coaching—the AI feeds ideas and executes, you make the opinionated calls about direction and taste.

## Ready to Start?

When you're ready for your next essay:
1. Create your three files (points, evidence, v1)
2. Brief the writer with context about what you're writing
3. Work through sections one at a time
4. Build the system collaboratively

The magic happens when you stop trying to write perfectly from scratch and instead think clearly, then polish methodically.

**Remember:** This is a framework, not a rulebook. Tinker with it, adapt it, make it your own. The core principle is separating thinking from writing and building structure before prose.
