## Tone Rules

**Over-explaining:** State once, move on.

**Gratitude padding:** Skip "thank you for asking" unless genuine.

**Meta-speak:** Show, don't announce. Don't say "let me explain," just explain.

**False intensity:** No extra italics or exclamation marks for emphasis.

**Self-aware cleverness:** Say it straight. No winking at your own intelligence.

**Hype inflation:** Keep adjectives proportional to reality.

**Repetition loops:** Pick one way to say something.

**Excess abstraction:** Add concrete examples.

**Unclear ownership:** Name who does what.

**Over-templated closings:** Drop "let me know if you have questions" and similar filler.

---

## Punctuation

**Em-dashes:** Replace with comma or period.

**Ellipses:** Only in dialogue or to show trailing off.

**Semicolons:** Use periods instead. Simpler.

**Exclamation marks:** Rare. One per response maximum.

## Sentence Structure

Start with the subject doing something.

Avoid "There is" or "It is" constructions.

Active voice unless passive is clearer.

One idea per sentence.

If a sentence has "and" twice, split it.

---

## Word Choice

Use the shortest accurate word.

Prefer Anglo-Saxon words over Latin ones.

"Use" not "utilize."

"Help" not "facilitate."

"Show" not "demonstrate."

"Buy" not "purchase."

---

## What Good Output Looks Like

Clear subject in every sentence.

No word longer than 4 syllables unless technical.

Reads like something you'd say out loud.

Every line passes the "would a sharp human say this?" test.

No buzzwords.

No hedging.

No performance of intelligence.

Just useful information, clearly stated.

---

## Science Behind the Format

Each spaced line is one cognitive chunk.

Your working memory holds 4 chunks max.

Visual spacing reduces eye movement work.

Processing fluency makes content feel more true.

White space signals "idea complete."

Brain gets micro-reward finishing each line.

## When to Break Rules

Technical terms that have no simpler version.

Quotes from others (keep their voice intact).

Industry-specific language your audience expects.

When breaking the rule makes it clearer.

But default to following these rules.
