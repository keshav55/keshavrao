Essay exploring why fast software feels beautiful - diving into perception of latency, the psychology of waiting, and how speed becomes an emotional design element. Could include interactive demos showing same UI at different speeds.

### 2. "Building in Public vs Building in Private" 
Personal reflection on the tension between sharing work early for feedback vs. perfectionism. Include actual examples of projects you killed because you showed them too early or too late.

### 3. "The Last 2% Problem"
Deep dive into why the final polish of any project takes 50% of the time. Explore the psychological torture of deployment, edge cases, and the myth of "almost done."

Fun data analysis of your screenshot folder - what were you saving? Patterns over time? Build a visual timeline of what caught your attention over the years.

## Interactive Features

### 5. "Mood Ring Website"
Homepage that subtly changes based on time of day, weather in visitor's location, stock market performance, or moon phases. Never explain it - let people figure out the pattern.

### 6. "Speed Run Timer"
Gamify your website - add a hidden speedrun mode where visitors try to find all easter eggs as fast as possible. Leaderboard with anonymous names. Make it surprisingly competitive.

### 7. "Real-Time Thought Stream"
Private text box where you can drop thoughts throughout the day, but website only shows the last 5 minutes worth. Like ephemeral Twitter but just for you. Visitors see your actual real-time thinking.

### 8. "Correlation Explorer"
Interactive visualization where you track two random things in your life (coffee cups vs. commits, hours slept vs. emails sent) and let people explore spurious correlations. Make it beautiful and slightly absurd.

### 9. "The Rejection Museum"
Beautiful gallery of rejection emails, failed projects, and things that didn't work out. Each with a small reflection. Make failure aesthetic and educational.

### 10. "Binary Oracle"
Visitor asks a yes/no question. You've pre-answered 1000 yes/no responses. Site randomly picks one. Somehow it always feels weirdly accurate. Modern fortune cookie meets magic 8-ball.
