# High Output Agent Management - Points

This file tracks the main contentions and points as we develop each section.

## i. Preview/Intro

**Thesis:** Agents are here and management is shifting—here's my philosophy on how to approach it: set up the system well, build instructions over time, put each agent in position to win.

**Contentions:**
1. Agents are here and changing how work happens, but most people treat them as transactional tools
2. Managing agents isn't entirely new—it's people management + systems wisdom applied to intelligence
3. The key distinction: most people "use the tool"; visionary people "build systems to orchestrate"
4. Building agent systems that compound is different from one-off prompting, and that's what this essay explores

## ii. The System

**Thesis:** An agent system—role + instructions + context + tools—is your real asset, not the model itself. Models come and go; systems compound over time.

**Contentions:**
1. An agent is defined by: role (what it does), instructions (how it does it), context (what it knows), and tools (what it can access)
2. The context bundle is the core asset—instructions, skills, style together create a portable, durable system
3. Style/personality matters: agents need a voice and approach that aligns with your vision, not just technical correctness
4. Models will upgrade and change, but a well-built system stays consistent and effective across different models
5. Think "team member" not "tool"—you're building systems that learn and improve, not one-off queries

## iii. The Problem - Cost Equation

**Thesis:** The real optimization game is shifting cost from attempts to upfront instruction clarity.

**Contentions:**
1. Every failed attempt costs twice—your time waiting AND tokens spent, compounding the damage
2. Uncontrolled iteration digs you deeper (wrong destination); directed iteration with clear success criteria is how you learn what works
3. The danger isn't iteration itself, it's not knowing your cost tolerance before you brief the agent
4. Clarity upfront (defining success precisely) reduces attempts; ambiguity forces iteration tax

## iv. The Solution - Planning & Context

**Thesis:** Build instructions collaboratively with the agent—be clear enough to avoid weird loops, iterate to catch misalignments early, and accept that perfect instructions are a myth.

**Contentions:**
1. Spend time planning context and instructions upfront so the agent gets it right the first time (Grove's leverage principle)
2. Build instructions hand-in-hand with the agent: have it understand, question itself, surface edge cases
3. Perfect instructions are a myth—aim for clarity that prevents confusion, then iterate based on what actually happens
4. If an agent goes rogue, it's ambiguous instructions or misaligned goals, not incompetence (same as managing people)
5. The craft is ongoing: you're not done after day one, you're continuously refining the system based on real usage

## v. Creative Selection

**Thesis:** As AI gets smarter, the human's job isn't less critical—it's more critical because you're the one with taste, judgment, and the ability to decide what matters.

**Contentions:**
1. Creative selection is the full spectrum—from "what problem matters" to "does this feel right?"—and that's where taste lives
2. Your taste is knowing when you've done the instruction work well enough to step back and let the agent rip
3. The payoff of clear systems is reclaiming time for strategic bets and directional calls that only you can make
4. Grove's leverage principle applies perfectly: multiply output through clear systems and high-leverage decisions, not through personal hours

## vi. Revisions + Learning

**Thesis:** Systems get smarter through feedback loops—measure task completion, output quality, and efficiency, then use that data to refine instructions and context.

**Contentions:**
1. Multi-perspective approach: test with different models to see which one handles your system best
2. Clear testing protocols: measure what matters—task completion, output quality, efficient context retrieval
3. Track hit rates (first-try accuracy), not just raw output—every retry is a cost signal
4. Feedback loops are critical: use real-world results to refine instructions, making the system leaner and smarter over time
5. The system compounds: better instructions → fewer retries → lower cost → more budget for creative work

## vii. Conclusion + Actions

**Thesis:** Humans bring memory, taste, and knowledge to agent systems—use this framework to think through your own approach to this emergent technology.

**Contentions:**
1. What makes humans special: memory (remembering context), taste (making opinionated calls), knowledge (understanding the domain)
2. Bring these superpowers to how you design and manage agents
3. Magic happens at the intersection of human judgment and agent execution
4. This framework is a lens, not a rulebook—everyone will tinker and find their own way
5. The call to action: think through your systems, experiment, and use this as a reference point for how to view emergent technology
