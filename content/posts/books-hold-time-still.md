I found my old books during Thanksgiving at home.

Each page triggered flashbacks to different parts of my life.

Margin notes revealed how I used to think about the future.

It's fascinating how books preserve not just their content, but our past selves.

These pages hold both stories and memories.

It's a beautiful reflection of time passing.

The connection between then and now feels surreal.
