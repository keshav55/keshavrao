description: 'On swimming, running, and finding rhythm.'

The first few minutes of swimming and running are always painful.

The initial inertia feels like arriving at a music festival, waiting for the beats to settle in.

You resist, then adapt, then flow.

Your mind wanders while your body moves on autopilot.

The resistance fades as rhythm takes over.

It's similar to deep work - the beginning is the hardest part.

Once you're in, you're in.

Time becomes fluid.

Thoughts float freely.

Everything aligns.

It's a beautiful feeling.

The state becomes addictive.
