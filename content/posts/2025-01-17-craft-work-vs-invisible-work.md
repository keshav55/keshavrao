It shouldn't take 20 messages to find a flow with AI.

That's usually the case. Twenty messages to get output that satisfies you. By then you're drowning in context, the AI is making things up, and you're ready to cancel your subscription.

To speed the process, we really need to define the type of work AI systems are focused on.

Invisible work just needs to get done. Pull the emails. Search the codebase. Format the document. Fast, accurate, no explanation needed. I don't want to watch or correct, just give me results. 

Craft work is different. There's no single right answer. Every decision shapes the outcome. If AI jumps to conclusions, I spend more time correcting than creating. This is why AI writing sounds soulless, why generated music feels empty, why no code platforms still require so much tweaking.

We need AI that gets this. When it's invisible work, just disappear and handle it. When it's craft work, stop trying to finish everything for me. Let's go one step at a time.

If you're building for invisible work, accuracy is everything. You're competing on how perfectly you can make problems disappear. Takes forever to get right but when you nail it, you've built something people actually need.

With craft work, it's different. At this point, there's a great baseline level of accuracy with all big AI models. This means that at a certain point, the AI is able to make decisions that are correct but it may not always align with the human's intuition or aesthetic preferences. The writing tool that makes the human feel more excited and confident about the essay they're releasing. The coding assistant that aligns with your logic and UI decisions before generating anything.

The magic is in decoupling the task at hand. For example, when creating a web app, you can have an agent focused on invisible work: organizing markdown documentation, cleanups, and deleting code. You can have another agent focused on craft work: designing the UI step by step, aligning with your logic, and making the app feel right.
