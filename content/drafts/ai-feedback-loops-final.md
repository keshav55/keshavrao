It shouldn't take 20 messages to get good output from AI.

Twenty messages to get output that satisfies you. By then you're drowning in context, the AI's making things up, and you're ready to cancel your subscription.

We're using one interface for two completely different types of work.

Invisible work just needs to get done. Pull the emails. Search the codebase. Format the document. Fast, accurate, no explanation needed. I don't want to watch or correct, just give me results.

Craft work is different. There's no single right answer. Every decision shapes the outcome. If AI jumps to conclusions, I spend more time correcting than creating. AI writing sounds soulless, generated music feels empty, no-code platforms still require so much tweaking.

We need AI that gets this. When it's invisible work, just disappear and handle it. When it's craft work, stop trying to finish everything for me.

That's why there are so many opportunities right now.

If you're building for invisible work, accuracy is everything. You're competing on how perfectly you can make problems disappear. Takes forever to get right but when you nail it, you've built something people actually need.

With craft work it's different. At this point there's a great baseline level of accuracy with all big AI models. This one is more about how someone feels when they make the outcome. The writing tool that makes the human feel more excited and confident about the essay they're releasing. The coding assistant that aligns with your logic and UI decisions before generating anything.
