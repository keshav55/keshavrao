sf right now

everyone's finding their groove with agents. some people are scared, some are building, some are watching. but the interesting part is how personal it's getting - like everyone's discovering their own way to work with these things.

it's not about the tools really. it's about finding what gets you in flow. for me it's archie hamilton at 2am with 4 claude instances running different tasks. for someone else it's morning coffee and cursor. 

the city feels different when everyone's experimenting at the same time. there's this energy of people just trying shit, seeing what sticks. 

what's wild is how fast the baseline is moving. what felt impossible last month is table stakes now. and everyone's adapting in their own way - finding their rhythm in this agent-first world.

it's not about AI taking over. it's about finding your way to create in a world where AI just... is.

right now I have 4 agents open. no chrome tabs. no context switching. just the set playing and this pure interface where I talk to a team.

this is flow state - not jumping between windows, not breaking concentration. just conversation and execution. the music keeps the rhythm, the agents handle the tasks.

it's the simplest interface possible: talk to your team, shit gets done. no clicking through menus or searching for buttons. just pure intent → action.

this is what computing should feel like.

the real question: how do we collapse the distance between thought and creation?

right now it's: idea → chat → agent → code/writing/output. but even this is revolutionary compared to idea → open IDE → write code → debug → deploy.

the dream is just thinking and having it exist. but maybe that's not even the point. maybe the conversation IS the interface. maybe talking through ideas with something that can immediately execute is the sweet spot.

because when you remove all the friction - no window switching, no context breaks, no searching for the right tool - you stay in the idea. you stay in flow. 

the gap between thought and reality gets smaller every week.

atris labs - speeding up everything for everyone

the vision is simple: make this flow state universal. not just for developers or tech people. everyone.

because right now I'm orchestrating 4 agents to build shit at 2am with archie hamilton playing. but why shouldn't a doctor do the same thing for diagnosis? or a teacher for lesson planning? or literally anyone trying to get ideas out of their head?

the infrastructure to go from thought → execution. that's it. 

can we sell to anyone? honestly yeah. because everyone has ideas stuck in their head. everyone wants to move faster. everyone's tired of clicking through interfaces when they could just... talk.

the market is everyone who thinks.
