# GTM Red Pill vs Blue Pill

## Raw thoughts

Modern GTM feels extractive. Like "I'll teach you" or "pay for our SaaS tool" - all these sales techniques designed to extract money from you. Or they go "value up front" but it's really just a tease so you pay for more value.

It's transactional and manipulative. Everyone running the same playbook:
- "Give value" (but really just teasing the real value)
- Build email list → nurture sequence → extract money
- Free trial → onboarding emails → convert before they realize
- "Book a demo" (high pressure sales call)

## The Jobs Approach (Red Pill)

Steve Jobs never sold you anything. He showed you a new reality and you sold yourself.

Blue pill GTM: "Here's our features, pricing tiers, book a demo, limited time offer"

Red pill: "This is how the world should work. Join us or don't."

The iPhone launch wasn't "10 reasons why you need a smartphone." It was "Today, Apple reinvents the phone."

No lead magnets. No email sequences. No "value ladder." Just pure conviction that what they built was right, and if you got it, you got it.

What's gross about modern GTM - it assumes you need to trick people into wanting your thing. If you need 47 touchpoints and behavioral psychology to sell it, maybe the thing itself isn't good enough.

## The Spiritual Dimension

Jobs had something else - the spiritual awareness, the Zen training, the intuition about what matters. The reality distortion field wasn't just confidence. It was seeing a different reality so clearly that others started seeing it too.

He went to India, studied with Zen masters, took acid. He understood that changing consciousness changes what's possible. The GTM wasn't about convincing people. It was about shifting their perception of reality.

When he said "bicycle for the mind" he meant it literally. Not a tool to do tasks faster, but something that fundamentally changes your relationship with the world.

That's why Apple stores feel like temples. Why the unboxing is a ritual. Why people camp outside for launches. He wasn't selling products. He was selling enlightenment through technology.

## The Secret Sauce

It's actually believing you're changing the world - not as a pitch deck line, but in your bones.

Most founders say "we're changing the world" while thinking about exit valuations. Jobs actually believed computers were bicycles for the mind, that design could elevate human consciousness, that technology should be at the intersection of liberal arts and sciences.

The spiritual practice gave him something crucial: detachment from the outcome while being fully committed to the process. Zen teaches you to hold things lightly but do them completely. That's why he could kill products he loved if they weren't perfect. Why he could wait years to release something.

The acid/psychedelic experience showed him that reality is more malleable than most people think. Once you've seen your entire perception of reality shift, you understand that consensus reality is just one option. That's the reality distortion field - knowing that what everyone agrees is "impossible" is just a collective hallucination.

The secret sauce: Deep spiritual conviction + direct experience of altered states + monk-like focus on craft + zero attachment to what people think.

You can't fake that. That's why copying Apple's marketing doesn't work. You're copying the surface without the consciousness behind it.
