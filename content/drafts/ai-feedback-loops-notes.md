# AI Feedback Loops - Context Gathering

## Core Thesis
- More valuable than building the 10,000th agent app: finding sync between user and AI
- The interface/rhythm matters more than features

## Key Observations

### Speed vs Research Modes
- Speed moments: telegraph-style, minimal tokens, just signal and response
- Research moments: can handle dumps, exploration, depth
- Problem: Most AI interfaces don't distinguish - treat every interaction the same

### Context Switching Problem
- Write → dump ideas → read everything again = breaks flow
- Less words to process helps in speed moments
- Reading helps with research moments

### Sync Patterns
- Everyone has different optimal sync pattern
- Some need brain dumps first
- Others want rapid back-forth
- Some want pushback, others pure execution

### Interface Failures
- Speed mode → AI gives tutorial (wrong)
- Research mode → AI gives bullets instead of depth (wrong)
- Paragraph in → paragraph out (not always right)

## What Makes Good Sync
- Prompting style
- How user types
- What data we give
- What needs user input vs what to omit
- Adapting feedback loop to user's current mode

## Questions to Explore
- How does the AI know which mode you're in?
- Can the interface itself signal the mode?
- What's the minimum viable sync?

## Craft Work vs Invisible Work

### Invisible Work
- Searching through emails to find info
- Processing PDFs to extract data
- Formatting imports and configs
- Resizing images for different platforms
- The stuff that DRAGS you out of craft work
- Should vanish, be handled, disappear

### Craft Work
- Making interpretation of the results
- Choosing the essay's opening line
- Deciding the function's approach
- Picking the color palette
- The decisions that make something YOURS
- Where humans should spend MORE time

### The Problem
- AI tries to make craft work invisible ("here's your complete essay!")
- While keeping invisible work visible (watch me fix each import)
- Building backwards - automating soul while showing process

### The Insight
- The real value isn't in doing the invisible work
- It's in the interpretation and decisions AFTER
- AI should handle invisible → human does craft on the results
- Not: AI does both → human becomes reviewer

## Same AI, Different Modes

### Invisible Mode
- Execute fully, return clean results
- No explanations needed
- Maximum accuracy
- Complete the loop
- "Format this doc" → formatted doc (no steps shown)

### Craft Mode
- Stop at decision points
- Surface options, not answers
- "Here's what you could do" not "here's what I did"
- Help shape thinking, not replace it
- Leave loops open for human judgment
- The nuances in structure, word choice, flow MATTER

### The Core Problem
- Most AIs default to "get it done" even for craft work
- Jump to conclusions without letting human touch the decisions
- Everything feels soulless because human wasn't involved in the craft
- The AI needs to recognize: "get it done" moment vs "help me think" moment

## Writing as Craft Work

### What Makes Writing Yours
- Voice: how YOU would say it
- Rhythm: where sentences break, build, pause
- Connections: the unexpected links only you'd make
- Word choice: the specific words that feel right to YOU

### The AI Slop Problem
- Statistical Average Voice™
- Safe word choices
- Generic transitions
- No personality or risk

### Better Approach: Collaborative Construction
- Build sentences together, one decision at a time
- AI surfaces options, human chooses direction
- Keep the human's voice and energy
- AI as writing partner, not writer
