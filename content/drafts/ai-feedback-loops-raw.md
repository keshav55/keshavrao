# AI Feedback Loops - Raw Draft

## Opening Flow

It shouldn't take 20 messages to find rhythm with the AI you're working with.

The common struggle is getting your AI system to really understand who you are. 20 messages to get to an output that satisfies you. By then you're in a context dump-hole where it starts making stuff up. Then you give up. Cancel the subscription. Complain on X.

The funny thing is you can modify a system prompt and slap a few markdown files to give your AI some more context. To be more the way you want it to be. But realize most people, especially new adopters, will not understand the benefits of a markdown file structure and let's say your frontend application.

What I've found interesting is a constant update to the system prompt and files without thinking too hard. And that's what made me realize about the two critical work types that gets us a hint on what AI should be: craft work vs invisible work.

Invisible work is one where you just need it done. Do the damn tool call. Pull the emails. Search fast. Get me my answers fast. And accurate. I don't want to autocorrect you.

Versus craft work is one where look, there is no one right answer. But if you go answer for me then you'll put me in a losing position - I have to spend more time correcting you. It's also work where human will always be in the loop. Because each step there's a taste decision that can significantly impact the outcome. This is why current AI writing tools aren't great. Or sound generators. Or even vibe-coding platforms.
