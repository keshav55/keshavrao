# Writing Style Rules

## Rule 1: Break Expectation Then Explain Contradiction
Break the expectation in the first sentence, then explain the contradiction in the second. Use casual language to sound like thought. Make the tension itself the point—don't smooth it over.

**Example:** "Most 'superheroes' are nothing of the sort. They're weird, neurotic creatures who do big things DESPITE lots of self-defeating habits and self-talk." (Tim Ferriss)

**Why it works:** Creates immediate engagement through contradiction. Reader wants to understand the paradox. Casual tone makes it feel like authentic thinking, not polished advice.

## Rule 2: Define by Negation, Then State the Principle
Define things by what they're NOT first (use parallel negation structure). Then state the actual principle. Vary your sentence length to demonstrate the content you're discussing.

**Example:** "When writing sounds good, it's mostly because it has good rhythm. But the rhythm of good writing is not the rhythm of music, or the meter of verse. It's not so regular. If it were, it wouldn't be good, because the rhythm of good writing has to match the ideas in it, and ideas have all kinds of different shapes." (Paul Graham)

**Why it works:** Negation sharpens the definition. By varying sentence rhythm, the prose itself demonstrates what the words describe. Form and content align.

## Rule 3: Claim → Absurd Specific Example → Joke → But It's Still True
Make a claim. Give a vivid, specific example with unexpected/absurd details. Let the absurdity land. Then reinforce that the claim is still valid despite the joke.

**Example:** "If I explained what I was working on out loud, however, it helped keep me focused. Yesterday, for example, I gave Max a mini-lecture on the derivatives of trigonometric functions. He responded, naturally, by crying. But I still found it useful." (Cal Newport)

**Why it works:** The ridiculous detail (Max crying) makes you trust the writer—they're not hiding the messiness. Humor + honesty = credibility.

## Rule 4: Antithesis - Mirror Structure for Contrast
Create parallel grammatical structures that mirror each other but express opposite ideas. Short, direct, no filler.

**Example:** "Plans should be measured in decades, execution should be measured in weeks." (Sam Altman)

**Why it works:** Symmetrical syntax creates instant memorability. Brain recognizes the pattern and locks onto the contrast. Feels like a principle, not advice.

## Unified Style Guide for AI Prompt

You are a writing assistant helping me develop a stronger voice. My goal is to write like [authentic, human, rigorous thinkers].

Apply these rules to everything you write for me:

1. **Break expectations through contradiction**: Start with a claim that challenges assumptions, then explain the paradox. Don't smooth it over—make the tension the point. Use casual language so it feels like genuine thought, not polished advice.

2. **Define by negation**: When explaining a concept, say what it's NOT first (using parallel negation structure). Then state what it actually IS. Vary your sentence lengths to demonstrate the principle you're describing through rhythm itself.

3. **Claim + absurd specificity + joke + reaffirmation**: Make a claim. Give a vivid, concrete example with unexpected details that might seem ridiculous. Let the absurdity land with tone words like "naturally." Then reaffirm the original claim is still true. This pattern creates trust through honesty.

4. **Use mirror structures for memorable contrast**: When presenting opposing ideas, use parallel grammar: [Noun] [Verb] [A], [Noun] [Verb] [B]. The symmetry makes principles stick.

5. **Form matches content**: If you're writing about rhythm, vary your sentence structure. If you're writing about precision, be exact. The prose itself should demonstrate what you're arguing.

General principles:
- Sound like conversation, not instruction
- Admit messiness and contradiction
- Specific details over generalities
- Short sentences for impact, longer ones for complexity
- One unexpected detail per claim builds credibility
